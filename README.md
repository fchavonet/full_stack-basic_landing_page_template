# Basic Landing Page Template

## Description

This project started with an idea from <a href="https://github.com/Eonvorax">Eonvorax</a>, a peer from Holberton School. He wanted a simple way to build a landing page without relying on complex templates. We worked together to design a basic and user-friendly page for one of his projects, focusing on the essentials.

## Objectives

- Develop a simple, easy-to-use landing page template based on a minimalist idea.
- Build the project using only HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
- Ensure the design is responsive and adapts well to all devices.
- Make the template easy to customize (logo, titles, text, colors).
- Keep the code clean and well-organized for easy maintenance.
- Offer a minimalist and beginner-friendly solution for personal or small projects.
- Encourage others to reuse and adapt the template freely.

## Installation & Usage

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    - Open your preferred Terminal.
    - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
    - Run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/fchavonet/web-basic_landing_page_template.git
```

2. Open the cloned repository.

### Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

2. Customize the page title and logo:
    - In the `<head>` section, change the content inside `<title>`:

    ```
    <title>My Awesome Project</title>
    ```

    - Also change the logo text inside the `<header>`:

    ```
    <h1><a href="#">MY AWESOME PROJECT</a></h1>
    ```

3. Edit the content:
    - You can modify titles (inside `<h3>` or `<h4>` tags) and text content (inside `<p>` tags) to fit your project.

    ```
    <h3 class="hidden-left">Your new title here</h3>
    <p class="hidden-right">Your custom description here.</p>
    ```

4. Update social media links:
    - At the bottom of the `index.html` file (in the `<footer>`), edit the `href` attributes inside each social link.

    ```
    <a class="social-icon" href="YOURGITHUBLINKHERE.com" target="_blank">
        <img src="./assets/images/social_icon-github.png" title="GitHub" alt="Github social icon">
    </a>
    ```

5. Customize the colors:
    - Open the `style.css` file and scroll to the `:root` section at the top.
    - Adjust these variables to match your brandâ€™s color palette. This will automatically update all major color elements across the site.

    ```
    :root {
        --primary-color: rgb(62.5, 125, 250);
        --secondary-color: rgb(50, 100, 200);
        --primary-dark-color: rgb(2, 4, 9);
        --secondary-dark-color: rgb(14, 17, 22);
        --primary-light-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);
        --secondary-light-color: rgb(240, 240, 240);
    }
    ````

6. Change the images:
    - Replace the existing images in the folder `./assets/images/screenshots` with your own.
    - Keep the same file names to avoid breaking image links.

> For gallery images, try to preserve the original proportions to maintain the layout.

7. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see your modifications.

8. Deploy your page:
    - You can host it for free using GitHub Pages:
        - Push your code to a GitHub repository.
        - Go to the repository `Settings > Pages`, set the source to main branch and save..
        - Your site will be live at https://your-username.github.io/repo-name.

## What's Next?

- Add essential SEO tags to improve search engine visibility.
- Replace the custom animation system with the [Animate On Scroll (AOS)](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) library for smoother and more efficient animations, especially on mobile devices.
- Create a JSON configuration file to manage editable page content (logo, titles, texts, etc.) more easily.

## Thanks
